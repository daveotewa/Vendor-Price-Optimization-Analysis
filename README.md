# Vendor-Price-Optimization-Analysis
This project analyzed pricing data from six fruit vendors to identify the most cost-effective supplier for bulk purchases. Using Excel, I automated price comparisons for apples, tomatoes, and bananas based on required quantities, calculating total costs and determining the best vendor for each product.
## Features
- **Automated Calculations:** `VLOOKUP`, `MIN`, and `INDEX/MATCH` to find optimal vendor.
- **Key Insight:** Vendor 3 reduced costs by ~15% for apples, tomatoes, and bananas.
- **Scalable:** Easy to add more vendors/products.

## How to Use
1. Open `vendors.xlsx`.
2. Update quantities in the "Consumption and Analysis" sheet.
3. Results auto-calculate (best vendor highlighted).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced Excel
- Data Analysis
